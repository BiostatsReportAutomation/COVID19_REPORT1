# COVID19_REPORT1
I intend to create a reproducible report that gives update on the spread of COVID-19 across US states.
This report will take its data source from the CDC website and create heat maps and other visual plots with tables to 
provide update information on the current pandemic.
There will be a step by step video on YouTube, and R code on how these reports are created and made dynamic to automatically update 
report under 1 min following a click of a button in knitr, as and when data source changes on CDC website.



As of now (March 20, 2020) this project is at the development stage.
Buiding a Youtube video to support, explanation of the R code used in generating this dynamic report.
